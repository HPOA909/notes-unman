To use the repository you will need to get my Qubes OS signing key, validate it
against sources in this mailing list, or at GitHub, or against different
downloads via Tor.

qvm-copy the key in to the arch template.
Add the key:
`sudo pacman-key --add <key>`
`sudo pacman-key --lsign unman`

`cd /etc/pacman.d`

Then either create a new file, or rename the existing
99-qubes-repository-4.0.conf.disabled to 99-qubes-repository-4.0.conf.
Open the conf file for editing - the contents should be:
[qubes-r4.0]
Server = https://qubes.3isec.org/arch/4.0


Then update:
`sudo pacman -Syuu`
