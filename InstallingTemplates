It's possible to build arch templates using qubes builder. Simply select
arch as a target in ./setup, run make install-deps, make qubes-vm and
make template.

If you are not sure about building for yourself, or don't have time,
I've decided to make pre-built arch templates available, as well as
hosting arch repositories.
You can download the pre-built template from https://qubes.3isec.org/Templates

All my templates, packages and repositories are signed with
my Qubes Signing key - you can get this from any keyserver. You
should check this against other sources - the Qubes-Users mailing list, 
[GitHub](https://github.com/unman/unman/blob/master/gpg-keys.asc), maybe another
keyserver over Tor.


You should do something like this, in a disposableVM:
Download the arch template from https://qubes.3isec.org/Templates

Once you have downloaded and confirmed my Qubes Signing Key, add it to
your keyring:
gpg -add <downloaded_key>

Check the signature on the template:
gpg <Template_file>

Once you are satisfied, install the Template.
To do this you will need to copy it to dom0:
qvm-run -p  <qube> 'cat <location of template>' > archtemplate

Then install :
sudo dnf install archtemplate
