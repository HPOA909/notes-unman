It's possible to build arch templates using qubes builder. Simply select
archlinux as a target in ./setup, run make get-sources, make qubes-vm, and
make template.

If you are not sure about building for yourself, or don't have time,
I've decided to make pre-built arch templates available, as well as
hosting arch repositories.
You can download the pre-built template from https://qubes.3isec.org/Templates

All my templates, packages and repositories are signed with
my Qubes Signing key - you can get this from any keyserver. You
should check this against other sources - the Qubes-Users mailing list, 
[GitHub](https://github.com/unman/unman/blob/master/gpg-keys.asc), maybe another
keyserver over Tor.


You should do something like this, in a disposableVM:
Download the arch template from https://qubes.3isec.org/Templates

Once you have downloaded and confirmed my "Qubes OS signing key", add it to
your rpm keyring:
`sudo rpm --import <downloaded_key>`

Check the signature on the template:
`rpm -K <Template_file>`
If all is well you will see "digests signatures OK"

Once you are satisfied, install the Template.
To do this you will need to copy it to dom0. In dom0 run:
`qvm-run -p  <qube> 'cat <location of template>' > archtemplate`

Then install, in dom0 :
`sudo dnf install archtemplate`
