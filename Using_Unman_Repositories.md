To use a repository you will need to get my Qubes OS signing key, validate it
against sources in the mailing list, Forum, at GitHub, or against different
downloads via Tor.

My signing key is available at https://github.com/unman/unman
In some circularity, the repository is signed with that key **but** the fingerprint is recorded in the file `gpg-keys.asc`.
**That** file is signed with my mail key, which is available from https://www.qubes-os.org/team

qvm-copy the key in to the Fedora template.
