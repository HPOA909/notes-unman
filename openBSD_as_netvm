Install OpenBSD as HVM Template 
Create netvm "openFW" using OpenBSD as template.
Set openFW virt_mode to HVM
Attach network device to openFW.

Create netvm - fw

Make sure that fw does not have netvm set:
qvm-prefs fw netvm none

Set fw as netvm for openFW.
qvm-prefs openFW netvm fw

Note IP address of openFW from 'qvm-ls -n openFW' 
Here address is 10.137.0.6

Start fw and openFW.

On fw netvm:
Identify vif to openFW - 
'ip route ' will show vifXX.0
Here output is "10.137.0.6 dev vif33.0....."

Add route to default gw 10.137.0.6:
ip route add default via 10.137.0.6

Configure forwarding on fw:
iptables -I FORWARD -i vif+ -o vif+ -j ACCEPT
(This allows all qubes connected to fw to interact - you may wish to be more
restrictive.)

Override Qubes restrictions:
iptables -t raw -I PREROUTING -i vif33.0 -j ACCEPT

Forward DNS traffic to external DNS server:
iptables -t nat -I PR-QBS -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to 9.9.9.9

(Put these in /rw/config/qubes-firewall-user-script
 chmod +x /config/qubes-firewall-user-script )


On openFW congiguration is more straightforward.
Run firewall script
Bring up em0 - dhclient em0
ifconfig xnf0 10.137.0.6 up

Set qubes to use fw as netvm using qvm-prefs
