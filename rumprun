Picking up the rump kernel.

Some issues with compiling on Fedora-29 with gcc 8.3.1
try suppressing warning in build of buildrump.sh:
./buildrump.sh -F CWARNFLAGS='-Wno-error=cast-function-type -Wimplicit-fallthrough=0'

./buildrump.sh -F CWARNFLAGS='-Wno-error=cast-function-type -Wimplicit-fallthrough=0 -Wno-tautological-compare -Wno-stringop-truncation'
That seems to build.
