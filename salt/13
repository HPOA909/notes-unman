Let's take a minute to recap what we've seen so far.

We can use salt to create qubes, set preferences, install and remove
software, and configure them down to the file system level.

Qubes has a special configuration of salt, and provides 'qubesctl' to run
salt commands.
We can use all the available salt modules and functions.

We can target commands at individual qubes, type of qube (Template,
standalone, TemplateBased), and, by using grains, at qubes sharing
characteristics.

After the break we'll start to put this together in to real life examples.

Remember, once you've put the effort in to writing the modules, you can
adapt and recreate your system with very little overhead.
That means you can take a clean Qubes install, pull down some modules and,
after some salt magic, have your personal qubes configured just the way you
like them - software and preferences intact. I'm sure you can see the
benefits for travel.
