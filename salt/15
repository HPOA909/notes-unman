In the last example we made a change to restrict outbound traffic from
sys-net.
Perhaps we want to make the same change to sys-firewall.
Because of the way we structured the module, we cant do this. So we should
rewrite it so that we can apply the changes separately.

copy1
copy2

So we apply the firewall change using copy1 and the MAC change using
copy2. Both are targeted to sys-net and just copy1 to sys-firewall.

Of course, we could have structured the file to apply different parts of it
to different qubes:

copy3

You can do whatever works best for you, and what you feel happy with.
Breaking down changes and grouping similar effects together generally makes
it easier to reuse code.
