In the last example we made a change to restrict outbound traffic from
sys-net.
Perhaps we want to make the same change to sys-firewall.
Because of the way we structured the module, we cant do this. So we should
rewrite it so that we can apply the changes separately.

copy_mac
edit_mac

copy_fw
edit_fw

So we apply the firewall change using copy_fw and the MAC change using
copy_mac. Both are targeted to sys-net and just copy_mac to sys-firewall.

Of course, we could have structured the file to apply different parts of it
to different qubes:

copy3

You can do whatever works best for you, and what you feel happy with.
Breaking down changes and grouping similar effects together generally makes
it easier to reuse code.
