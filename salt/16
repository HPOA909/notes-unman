Let's look at another example.

I want to extend the Debian template and have two qubes, one online and one
offline.

extend.sls

I use salt as a convenient way to keep track of what packages I've installed
in templates. If you do this, then you need never wonder about what you
installed, or have to think back to recreate your accidentally deleted
template.
All you need to do is pull down your salt file, and recreate the template.

Now we have the template let's create those qubes:

online.sls
offline.sls

One thing we can do with an offline qube, is use it as basis for the default
disposableVM.
And it would  be useful if we made sure that any files we have are
opened in those offline disposableVMs.

mailcap.sls
defaults.sls

Usually, the rule is not to transfer files from an untrusted qube to a
(more) trusted one.
But if we have a work qube based on a minimal template then we can transfer
files to it and store them there, and we can do this (relatively ) safely
because we will never open the files in that qube. Instead we will always
open them in an offline, fully featured, disposable qube.
