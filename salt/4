Now that tbb has been created, make sure it is up to date.

Salt has a module named 'pkg' to work with package managers.
pkg will try to do the right thing whether it's apt, dnf, or pacman.

update-browser.sls

That makes it easy to update the template.


What about updating *all* the templates?

update-templates.sls

The only new thing here is the way the target is set in the top file.
Qubes provides a special module, (a pillar in salt terms), which predefines
some useful targets.
qubes:type:template 
qubes:type:standalone
qubes:type:app

You can use these in your own salt files.


You can use pkg to install, remove, and purge packages. Because it's
agnostic about the package manager, that makes it easy to work on
templates regardless of OS.

To remove firefox from the browser template:
remove.sls

Of course, you can use pkg to install (or remove) multiple packages:
multiple.sls

And you can specify particular versions of packages to be installed:
versions.sls

If you remove a package, then packages that were installed with it
will not be removed. (This is normal behaviour on Debian.)
On Debian, I suggest running 'apt-get autoremove' to clear these extra
packages. (There is a module for aptpkg control, but in my experience
the results are not good.)

How do you run a command in a qube using salt?
Like this:

autorm.sls
