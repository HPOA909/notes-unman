We've seen two methods for running commands with qubesctl: cmd.run and
qvm.run
Salt has native functions for all sorts of commands.
'qubesctl sys.doc' will give you a long list of functions showing the
functions and documentation. Pipe the output through more to read more
easily.

Let's say we want to untar a file.
We could use cmd.run or qvm.run, or run qvm-run from dom0.

Or we can use the builtin salt function, archive.tar .

untar.sls

Notice how we can specify tar options, and also options for running the
command.

Of course, we can create archives using tar as well.

tar.sls

The archive function can handle zip, tar, rar, and zip, and can work with
encrypted files.
'qubesctl sys.doc archive' will give more detail.
