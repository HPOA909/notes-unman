We've seen simpple examples.
Here's agood case where using salt comes in to its own.
We want to run a command but we need the program to be installed on the
target.
Using salt it's simple:

untar2.sls

Notice how we used "order" to make sure that states are handled in the order
we want.
Salt actually has a pretty good mechanism for dealing with states, but you
can always use "order" or "requisites" to make sure that things run as you
want.
Remember that 'pkg' will work with any flavour of template and will use the
native package handler.

When the file is on the target system everyhtign works fine.
What if it isnt there?
That's odd - we still get "OK"
Let's look at the log : it's in /var/log/qubes/mgmt-browser.log

We see the error reported in the log.
So remember, when using qubesctl you should check the log and not trust the
command output.
That's the biggest issue in using qubesctl at the moment.
