In that last example, the file to untar was already on the target system.
Can we put a file on the target?
In dom0 you could use 'qvm-copy-to-vm'.

In salt you can copy a file like this:

filecopy.sls

Let's unpack this a bit.
The first line determines what the file will be named on the target.
The source is salt://testfile
What does that mean?
The statement is relative to /srv/salt if you are using 'base', so qubesctl
will be looking for a file at /srv/salt/testfile.
You can create a directory under /srv/salt - /srv/salt/browser - and store
the file there.
Then the source should refer to salt://browser/testfile

It's good to keep things tidy.
You can keep sls and top files in subdirectories too - If you move
filecopy.sls to /srv/salt/browser you can reference it as browser.filecopy

This makes it easier to make sure that names are unique *and* easier to keep
track of your files.

You can give a list of sources, and the first one found will be used.

Using file.managed is like pkg.installed: it will ensure that the file in
present on the target qube.
