We've seen a simple use of the file module with file.managed to get files on
the target system.

You can use file.absent to ensure that a file is *not* present. (If it is it
will be deleted.)

You can copy files using file.copy:

copy.sls

Rename files usign file.rename:

rename.sls

See how we use "Force" to make sure than existing files are overwritten?

The file module also works on directories, and has file.directory:

dir.sls
