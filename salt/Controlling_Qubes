It's relatively easy to control and configure Qubes using shell scripts,
and the dom0 tools.

Qubes also provides 'qubesctl' which allows you to use salt for the same
purpose.
You describe how you want the system to work in a .sls file.
Then you provide a .top file which describes the target you want to
configure, and which states to apply.
You enable the state.
Then you apply it to the system

To enable a state:
qubesctl top.enable <foo>

To disable a state:
qubesctl top.disable <foo>

To see what states are enabled:
qubesctl top.enabled

To apply state:
qubesctl --target <bar> state.apply

Instead of naming targets, you can use
qubesctl --templates .... to target all templates
qubesctl --app .... to target all AppVMs
qubesctl --all .... to target all non-disposable VMs

Let's look at some simple examples:

To create a new template cloned from debian-9 template:
examples/clone.sls
clone.top shows the target is dom0:
the state to be applied is described in clone.sls

Enable the new state
qubesctl top.enable clone

And apply it:
qubesctl --target dom0 state.apply

You see the results.
Confirm that the new template has been created.
